# Fast-Region-Swap
Reduces initial loading time when switching servers in League of Legends.
This application:
- Adjusts your region to the region of choice.
- Remembers your user name for other regions if "remember me" was selected.
- Automatically runs League of Legends.

1.) Upon creating, place the .exe file in your Riot Games/League of Legends folder.
2.) Run and select your region of choice by selecting the appropriate number.
3.) Log in and enjoy reduced loading times to play with friends faster around the world.

If you create a shortcut this can act as a new launcher since it will launch Leauge of Legends anyways.
